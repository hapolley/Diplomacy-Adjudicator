# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.1.0   | :x:                |
| >1.10   | :x:                |            

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Once the project gets started you will be able to report a vulnerability.

Later we will tell them where to go, how often you can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
