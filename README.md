# Diplomacy-Adjudicator
To create a new Markup Code as an intermediate step to Translating old Basic programming code that runs a Diplomacy Adjudicator into Python.
As time allows, I will attempt to translate parts of the PB programs into a Markup language I am in the process of creating.
Visit the following GitHub to view or help with the Creation and translation:
'https://github.com/hap2u/Power-Basic to Created Markup'
As the old code turns into the New Code, we will post it on this site.
Before all this happens we will first Copyright the New Markup Language.
